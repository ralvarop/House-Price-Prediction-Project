# Bank Churn Prediction Project

## :bank: About The Project

The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Bank Customer Churn Prediction dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.

## üöÄ Project Highlights

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values and outliers
- **Feature Scaling:** Applying normalization and standardization for improved performance
- **Model Selection:** Testing various algorithms to identify the best-performing model
- **Data Visualization:** Creating insightful visualizations for better understanding
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using various metrics
